# The folder for Flare
This folder should be used to post any assets that do are not added to the code.

## Structure
Each asset should get its own folder with the structure shown below:

```
AssetName - The folder with the name of the asset <br>
  README.md - readme file to describe what the asset is and what is contained in the folder <br>
  AssetName.blend - the main model of the asset <br>
  AssetName.* - any other file for the asset and the extension of it <br>
```

This can be used to allow for easy use.
