## Description
This is a 3D Sity Builder that has tower defense actions and of course roguelite features. The Towers can be chosen by cards in a deck and the player can also use another deck to fight. The AI will find the best path to the players heart. This can be done by destroying towers and other features or talents they have. The player will survive a series of days increasing in difficulty. Each day will be broken into a day and night phase. The day will be building and planning, and night will be enemies and fighting. The hero will determine what decks the player gets and the ways to fight.

### Tower Defense
The Base and "Heart" must be defended with towers and other armaments. They will also interact with the enemy in their own way to help the towers.

### City Planner
The map is similar to a world and has features the player can use to their advantage. They will also manage resources of their town.

### Phases
Each wave will be broken into 2 phases. <br>
The first is the Planning phase. This will be where the user can interact with buildings with the cards in there hand and buildings will perform their actions. <br>
The second phase will be the combat phase which is where the user will interact with enemies by cards in their hand and enemies will fight. <br>
If they survive every cycle then they win.

### Deckbuilding
The actions of the player will be controlled by a deck. <br>
There will be a planning and combat deck that the player will use. <br>
Each deck will have its own stregnths and weaknesses. <br>
This will work via a "hero" system

### RTS
The combat phase will run in real time rather than turns. <br>
The player must act on time with cards in both phases. <br>
However flipping to the combat cycle will be chosen by the player.

### System
This will be made with 3D graphics and operate on a 2D grid. <br>
The game will be topdown. <br>
This is meant for mobile but can be run on realistically anything.

## But Why
- I want to make a game of this style and learn Unity.
- This gives me an opportunity to learn best movement.
- I have an artist who wants to learn Blender.
- The artist is 2D and wants to learn 3D
