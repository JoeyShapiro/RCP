 A 3D Sim Game with Art

## Description
This is a 3D Sity Builder that has tower defense actions and of course roguelite features. The Towers can be chosen by cards in a deck and the player can also use another deck to fight. The AI will find the best path to the players heart. This can be done by destroying towers and other features or talents they have. The player will survive a series of days increasing in difficulty. Each day will be broken into a day and night phase. The day will be building and planning, and night will be enemies and fighting. The hero will determine what decks the player gets and the ways to fight.

## But Why
- I want to make a game of this style and learn Unity.
- This gives me an opportunity to learn best movement.
- I have an artist who wants to learn Blender.
- The artist is 2D and wants to learn 3D
